# Icequake_Earthquake_Discrimination
Discrimination between Icequakes and Earthquakes in Southeast Alaska 

### Necessary Dependencies

1) Numpy
2) Matplotlib
3) Obspy
4) Scipy
5) Scikit-Learn
6) tqdm
7) tsfresh


### Naming convention of waveforms

1) I have named the downloaded icequakes and earthquakes for each station in a very specific way that helps me in processing. 
2) A typical icequake waveform is named icequake(its number on catalog)_(station name).mseed
   For example - icequake which appears at 244th in the USGS event catalog and recorded at stationn "SCM" will be named as icequake244_SCM.mseed
3) Same naming convention applies for the earthquake waveforms
